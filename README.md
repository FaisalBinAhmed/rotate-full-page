# rotate-full-page

This extension is mainly created for out of my own necessity.
This is just a super basic tool that only does one thing: change the orientation of the full page.
If you're like me who sometimes browse your laptop while lying in the bed, you might find it useful.

Please use the context menu to change the orientation. The extension at the moment has no other feature.

Important: 
1. for this extension to work, you have to reload the page after installing it.
2. This won't work for all sites, as many sites have their own complex custom styling that depends on the page orientation.
3. you have to manually change the orientation again, after a page refresh.

And finally, the extension needs permission in order to change the style of the page. Nothing is collected/transferred from this extension. The source code is open source, if you want to check it out (or contribute!)
